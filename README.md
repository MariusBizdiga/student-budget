# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### PROJECT DESCIPTION.

we have three major root folders for this project

1. components
2. Firebase 
3. Hook 


components consists of the expense - exp.jsx , home - index.jsx , transaction - trans.jsx

--- inside the exp.jsx file consist of the following methods
   -- it handles the total balance calculations
   -- AddTransView method  - this handles the logic the users inputs and sending to the database (firebase);
   -- Expense method  - this displays the AddTransView and the expense and income boxes  

-- inside the trans.jsx consist of the following methods
  -- TransactionCell handles generating transaction history;
  -- Transaction is the main JSX.Element that handles both the filtering and displaying of the              TransactionCell on the DOM.

--  index.jsx handles both the organisation of the Expense and Transaction methods both from the exp.jsx and trans.jsx


the Hook folder

--- createUser.js is use to create unique ids for users that is stored in the users local storage for identification of each users. no single users account can conflict with any other users
   inside the createUser method has the following methods - createUser method that create users unique id using uuid , - getUserId method helps to fetch each users identity from the local storage


---  useDatabases.js  has one method called addTransaction that is connected to the trans.jsx. it gets users expense / income data from trans.jsx and sends to firebase 


--- useUsersData has useUsersData method that fetches all transactions related to a specific user from firebase .



The Firebase folder has Config.js file this holds the firebase configuration ensure to change to your own firebase config from firebase .
